# Testing

## Unit Tests

Vitest and Testing Library verify:

- Foundation presentation and semantic heading structure
- Loading, error, and not-found application states
- Health endpoint status, payload, cache policy, and method behavior
- Environment validation, site configuration, utilities, shared UI primitives,
  and security header configuration
- Supabase database configuration and server client creation
- Clerk proxy configuration, authenticated account protection, and
  authentication presentation components

Coverage is collected with the V8 provider. The configured minimum is 80 percent
for statements, branches, functions, and lines across the Milestone 0 foundation
surface.

## End-to-End Tests

Playwright runs Chromium in desktop and mobile profiles. It verifies:

- The application renders the expected primary heading
- The viewport has no horizontal overflow
- Axe reports no automated accessibility violations
- The health endpoint responds successfully through the running application
- The sign-in page shell renders
- Anonymous visitors are redirected away from protected account access

Playwright starts the compiled Next.js production server. Run `npm run build`
before `npm run test:e2e` when executing the checks individually.

## Local Commands

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:e2e
```

Generated coverage, reports, screenshots, traces, and test results are ignored by
Git.
